        <h1>Overview of Andaman and Nicobar Islands</h1>
        <p>The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a group of over 570 islands located in the Bay of Bengal. Known for their pristine beaches, crystal-clear waters, and lush green rainforests, these islands are a paradise for nature lovers and adventure seekers. The capital, Port Blair, serves as the gateway to the islands and is rich in colonial history, evident from landmarks like the Cellular Jail. The islands are home to indigenous tribes, including the Great Andamanese, Onge, Jarwa, and Sentinelese, who have lived in isolation for centuries, preserving their unique way of life.</p>
