                Mizoram, one of the northeastern states of India, is known for its lush greenery, scenic landscapes, and
                rich culture. The state is home to several tribes, primarily the Mizos, who have their own distinct
                language, traditions, and way of life. Mizoram is also known as the 'Land of the Highlanders' and is
                characterized by its rolling hills, pleasant climate, and a strong sense of community.

            <p>
                The traditional attire of the Mizo people is known for its vibrant colors and intricate patterns. Men
                often wear a traditional outfit called the "Puan," which is a type of wraparound skirt worn with a
                jacket. Women wear a more elaborate version of the Puan, often adorned with beautiful hand-woven designs.
                The colors and designs of the Puan vary according to the occasion and the wearer's social status.
